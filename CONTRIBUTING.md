# Contributing to PlotlySupply.jl

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PlotlySupply.jl. It's people like you that make open source such a great community.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/jake-w-liu/PlotlySupply.jl/issues/new)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, please include as much detail as possible. This might include:

- A description of the bug and the behavior you expected.
- A minimal, reproducible example.
- The version of PlotlySupply.jl you are using.
- Your Julia version.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature, please provide a clear and detailed explanation of the proposed enhancement. Include why you think it would be a valuable addition to the project and, if possible, provide a code snippet or pseudo-code demonstrating its usage.

## Project Scope

PlotlySupply.jl aims to be a lightweight wrapper around PlotlyJS.jl, providing high-level abstractions for common 2D and 3D plots. The goal is to simplify the creation of plots with a consistent and intuitive API.

Contributions should align with this scope. We are particularly interested in:

- Improving existing plotting functions.
- Adding new high-level plotting functions that are commonly used.
- Enhancing documentation and examples.
- Fixing bugs and improving performance.

We are generally not looking to:

- Add highly specialized or niche plot types.
- Replicate the full functionality of PlotlyJS.jl.
- Introduce significant new dependencies.

1.  Fork the repository and create a new branch from `main`.
2.  Make your changes.
3.  Add tests for your changes.
4.  Ensure your code is well-documented.
5.  Open a pull request.
